Cheeseformice is a parody game of the popular indie multiplayer game, Transformice, which is
an online multiplayer Flash game released on 1 May 2010.

The main objective of the game is to collect a piece of cheese placed somewhere on the map. 
The game consists of many maps. Players control a mouse with the WASD keys to run and jump. The players' mice must touch the cheese to collect it. After
which, the player must take it back to the map's mouse hole to finish. There can be 2 to 4 players.

The first mouse to go through the hole depending on the time finished gets 100 points,
the second mouse gets 75 points, the third mouse gets 50 points and the last gets 25 points. 
The mouse that gets the most points after three rounds wins the game.

To play the game, the machines must have Java installed. They can then simply double-click the JAR file.

One of the players must act as the server, which can be done by choosing "Server" in the dropdown in the upper-right of the main menu. Doing so will display the IP address of the server.

The other players, which must choose "Client", will input the IP address of the server. The server can then start the game, and the clients can follow.

The bottom-left portion of the screen is dedicated to the chat system while the bottom-right displays the scoreboard.
